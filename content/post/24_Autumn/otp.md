If you're specifically looking for number sequence-based authentication codes (like OTPs, often consisting of 6 digits), the following options are most suitable:

## 1. **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) using `twilio-otp` or `java-totp`**

   **TOTP** (Time-based One-Time Password) generates numeric sequences that change periodically (e.g., every 30 seconds). It is a commonly used mechanism for two-factor authentication (2FA), and it generates a sequence of numbers, typically 6 digits.

   - **Maven dependency**:
     ```xml
     <dependency>
       <groupId>com.warrenstrange</groupId>
       <artifactId>googleauth</artifactId>
       <version>1.4.0</version>
     </dependency>
     ```

   - **Example usage (with `java-totp`)**:
     ```java
     import com.warrenstrange.googleauth.GoogleAuthenticator;
     
     GoogleAuthenticator gAuth = new GoogleAuthenticator();
     int otp = gAuth.getTotpPassword("your-secret-key");
     ```
      This will generate a 6-digit numeric OTP based on a time-window.

## 2. **HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password) using `commons-codec`**
   **HOTP** generates numeric sequences based on a counter (not time-based like TOTP). It is also a number-based sequence and typically results in a 6-digit or longer OTP.

   - **Maven dependency**:
     ```xml
     <dependency>
       <groupId>commons-codec</groupId>
       <artifactId>commons-codec</artifactId>
       <version>1.15</version>
     </dependency>
     ```

   - **Example usage**:
     ```java
     import org.apache.commons.codec.digest.HmacUtils;
     import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base32;
   
     byte[] key = new Base32().decode("your-secret-key");
     long counter = 12345L;  // A counter you maintain
     int otp = HmacUtils.hmacSha1(key, counter);
     ```
      This approach generates a numeric sequence based on a secret key and counter value.

## 3. **Custom Number Generation using `SecureRandom`**
   If you just need a random sequence of numbers (e.g., for simple email verification codes), you can use `SecureRandom` to generate a numeric sequence.

   - **Example usage**:
     ```java
     import java.security.SecureRandom;
   
     SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
     int otp = 100000 + random.nextInt(900000);  // Generates a 6-digit number
     ```
      This will generate a 6-digit numeric OTP, which is simple and effective for most email verification needs.

## Summary:
- **TOTP** and **HOTP** are ideal if you need more secure, standardized OTPs with time-based or counter-based mechanisms (usually for 2FA).
- **Custom random number generation** using `SecureRandom` is the simplest method for generating a numeric sequence, typically for less security-critical scenarios like email verification.

If you need a secure numeric OTP, **TOTP** or **HOTP** is the better choice, especially for systems requiring re-verification over time or multiple verification attempts.
