## Composite key
```java
@Entity
public class BookAuthor {
    @EmbeddedId
    private BookAuthorId id;

    @ManyToOne
    @MapsId("bookId")
    private Book book;

    @ManyToOne
    @MapsId("authorId")
    private Author author;

    // Other fields, getters, setters...
}

@Embeddable
public class BookAuthorId implements Serializable {
    private Long bookId;
    private Long authorId;

    // Constructors, equals, hashCode...
}
```
### Pros
* Naturally represents the relationship between entities.
* Ensures data integrity at the database level.
* Can be more **space-efficient** in some cases.
* Useful when the combination of fields has a natural, real-world uniqueness.
### Cons
* Can be **more complex to work with in queries and code**.
* May lead to longer primary keys, which can impact performance in large tables.
* Less flexible if the relationship structure changes.
## Separate primary key
```java
@Entity
public class BookAuthor {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    private Book book;

    @ManyToOne
    private Author author;

    // Other fields, getters, setters...
}
```
### Pros
* Simpler to work with in code and queries.
* More flexible if relationships change.
* Can **improve performance** in some scenarios, especially with large datasets.
* Easier to reference from other tables.
### Cons
* Requires an additional column in the table.
* May not represent the natural relationship as clearly.
## Consideration
### Consider using a Composite Key
* The combination of foreign keys naturally and uniquely identifies the relationship.
* You want to enforce referential integrity at the database level.
* The relationship is **stable** and unlikely to change.
* You’re working with a **relatively small** dataset.
### Consider using a Separate Primary Key
* 1 You need more flexibility in your data model.
* 2 You’re working with **large datasets** where query performance is crucial.
* 3 You anticipate changes in the relationship structure.
* 4 You want to simplify your code and queries.
* 5 You need to **reference this join table from other entities**.
### Additional Considerations
* Database Performance: Test both approaches with your expected data volume to see which performs better.
* ORM Tool: Some ORM tools work better with one approach over the other.
* Team Preference: Consider what your team is more comfortable working with.
* Existing Patterns: If your project already uses one approach consistently, it might be best to stick with it for consistency.

In many modern applications, **using a separate primary key is often preferred** due to its simplicity and flexibility. However, there are still valid use cases for composite keys, especially in systems where the relationship itself has significant business meaning.
