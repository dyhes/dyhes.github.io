**Energy**

* Kinetic
* Poteintial

**Energy and Work**

* Energy = amount of work possible
* Work = energy actually used

**Temperature** = Average $E_{kin}$ of Atoms

**Entropy** = measure of disorder

Pratically, entropy tells us some forms of energy are **more useful** for doing work than others.

e.g. Fridge is not an isolated system, and will heat up the room more than it will cold down the water, increasing the total entropy
