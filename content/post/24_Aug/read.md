## How to read faster
* Cut the Inner Monologue 
  try reading without sounding out the words in your head
* Read With Your Finger 
  our eyes kind of naturally jump around and it takes **mental effort** to keep our eyes focused on each line
* Stop reading content you don’t like
  skip entire book or chapter when you don’t like the contents, table of contents he
* Schedule Reading
  utilize scattered time
* Read more than one book simultaneously

## How to remember What you read
* Highlighting and note-taking is basically **worthless**.
* We remember what’s **useful**
  * find ways to implement ideas you read into your life
  * mental effort: how does this(things I read) apply to my own life?
  * there are ways to kind of trick your brain into thinking that you were using the stuff you read
    * talk about the ideas to somebody else (humans tend to see social interactions as the most useful and important things)
* Instead of remembering the details of a book, remember overview of the book, and look it up when actually in need.
