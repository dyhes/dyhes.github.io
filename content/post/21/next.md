## fromSomeBlog

We create a dynamic URL by creating a dynamic page with the `[]` syntax.

How? We add a `pages/blog/[id].js` file. This file will handle all the dynamic URLs under the `/blog/` route

The router is a library provided by Next.js.

We import it from `next/router`:

```js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
```

and once we have `useRouter`, we instantiate the router object using:

```js
const router = useRouter()
```

Once we have this router object, we can extract information from it.

In particular we can get the dynamic part of the URL in the `[id].js` file by accessing `router.query.id`.

The dynamic part can also just be a portion of the URL, like `post-[id].js`.

So let's go on and apply all those things in practice.

Create the file `pages/blog/[id].js`

Create the file `pages/blog/[id].js`:

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default () => {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Blog post</h1>
      <p>Post id: {router.query.id}</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Link

 If you need to link to an *external* page outside the Next.js app, just use an `<a>` tag without `Link`.

If you need to add attributes like, for example, `className`, add it to the `a` tag, *not* to the `Link` tag

In Next.js, a **page** is a [React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

Next.js can serve **static assets**, like images, under **the top-level [`public` directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving)**. Files inside `public` can be referenced from the root of the application similar to [`pages`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).

### Image

 Using primitive html image tag means you have to manually handle:

- Ensuring your image is responsive on different screen sizes
- Optimizing your images with a third-party tool or library
- Only loading images when they enter the viewport

And more. Instead, Next.js provides an `Image` component out of the box to handle this for you.

Images are lazy loaded by default. That means your page speed isn't penalized for images outside the viewport. Images load as they are scrolled into viewport.

(the url didn't include public)

### Head

In addition to metadata, scripts that need to load and execute as soon as possible are usually added within the `<head>` of a page. Using a regular HTML `<script>` element, an external script would be added as follows:

```html
<Head>
  <title>First Post</title>
  <script src="https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js" />
</Head>
```

### Script

[`next/script`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/script) is an extension of the HTML `<script>` element and optimizes when additional scripts are fetched and executed.

```jsx
export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>First Post</title>
      </Head>
      <Script
        src="https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"
        strategy="lazyOnload"
        onLoad={() =>
          console.log(`script loaded correctly, window.FB has been populated`)
        }
      />
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Back to home</a>
        </Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  )
}
```

Notice that a few additional properties have been defined in the Script component:

- `strategy` controls when the third-party script should load. A value of `lazyOnload` tells Next.js to load this particular script lazily during browser idle time
- `onLoad` is used to run any JavaScript code immediately after the script has finished loading. In this example, we log a message to the console that mentions that the script has loaded correctly

### CSS Modules

**Important:** To use [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css), the CSS file name must end with `.module.css`.

This is what [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) does: *It automatically generates unique class names*. As long as you use CSS Modules, you don’t have to worry about class name collisions.

Furthermore, Next.js’s code splitting feature works on [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) as well. It ensures the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for each page. This results in smaller bundle sizes.

[CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) are extracted from the JavaScript bundles at build time and generate `.css` files that are loaded automatically by Next.js.

#### Global Modules

[CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) are useful for component-level styles. But if you want some CSS to be loaded by **every page**, Next.js has support for that as well.

To load [global CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet) files, **create a file called [`pages/_app.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app)** with the following content:

```jsx
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

This `App` component is the top-level component which will be common across all the different pages. You can use this `App` component to keep state when navigating between pages

**Important:** You need to restart the development server when you add [`pages/_app.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app).

In Next.js, you can add [global CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet) files by importing them from [`pages/_app.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app). You **cannot** import global CSS anywhere else.

The reason that [global CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet) can't be imported outside of `pages/_app.js` is that global CSS affects all elements on the page.

You can place the global CSS file anywhere and use any name. So let’s do the following:

- Create a top-level `styles` directory and create `global.css` inside.

## Pre-rendering

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: [**Static Generation**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) and [**Server-side Rendering**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering). The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- [**Static Generation**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then *reused* on each request.
- [**Server-side Rendering**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

In development mode (when you run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`), every page is [pre-rendered](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering) on each request — even for pages that use [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended).

 in Next.js, when you export a page component, you can also export an `async` function called [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation).

### getStaticProps

- In **development** (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`), [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) runs on *every request*.
- In **production**, [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) runs at *build time*. However, this behavior can be enhanced using the [`fallback` key](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#the-fallback-key-required) returned by [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation)

If you need to fetch data at **request time** instead of at build time, you can try [**Server-side Rendering**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering)

To use [Server-side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering), you need to export [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering) instead of [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) from your page.

```js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      // props for your component
    }
  }
}
```

Because [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering) is called at request time, its parameter (`context`) contains request specific parameters.

You should use [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering) only if you need to pre-render a page whose data must be fetched at request time. Time to first byte ([TTFB](https://web.dev/time-to-first-byte/)) will be slower than [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) because the server must compute the result on every request, and the result cannot be cached by a [CDN](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview) without extra configuration.



If you **do not** need to pre-render the data, you can also use the following strategy (called [**Client-side Rendering**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fetching-data-on-the-client-side)):

- Statically generate (pre-render) parts of the page that do not require external data.
- When the page loads, fetch external data from the client using JavaScript and populate the remaining parts.

### Fetching Data at Request Time

If you need to fetch data at **request time** instead of at build time, you can try [**Server-side Rendering**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering):

![Server-side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/static/images/learn/data-fetching/server-side-rendering-with-data.png)

To use [Server-side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering), you need to export [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering) instead of [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) from your page.

#### Using `getServerSideProps`

Here’s the starter code for [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering). It’s not necessary for our blog example, so we won’t be implementing it.

```
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      // props for your component
    }
  }
}
```

Because [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering) is called at request time, its parameter (`context`) contains request specific parameters.

You should use [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering) only if you need to pre-render a page whose data must be fetched at request time. Time to first byte ([TTFB](https://web.dev/time-to-first-byte/)) will be slower than [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) because the server must compute the result on every request, and the result cannot be cached by a [CDN](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview) without extra configuration.

#### Client-side Rendering

If you **do not** need to pre-render the data, you can also use the following strategy (called [**Client-side Rendering**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fetching-data-on-the-client-side)):

- Statically generate (pre-render) parts of the page that do not require external data.
- When the page loads, fetch external data from the client using JavaScript and populate the remaining parts.

![Client-side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/static/images/learn/data-fetching/client-side-rendering.png)

This approach works well for user dashboard pages, for example. Because a dashboard is a private, user-specific page, SEO is not relevant, and the page doesn’t need to be [pre-rendered](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering). The data is frequently updated, which requires request-time data fetching.

#### SWR

The team behind Next.js has created a React hook for data fetching called [**SWR**](https://swr.vercel.app/). We highly recommend it if you’re fetching data on the client side. It handles caching, revalidation, focus tracking, refetching on interval, and more. We won’t cover the details here, but here’s an example usage:

```jsx
import useSWR from 'swr'

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetch)

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
}
```

#### Catch-all Routes

Dynamic routes can be extended to catch all paths by adding three dots (`...`) inside the brackets.

### API routers

You should **not** fetch an API Route from [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) or [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation). Instead, write your server-side code directly in [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) or [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) (or call a helper function).

Here’s why: [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) and [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) runs only on the server-side. It will never be run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser. That means you can write code such as direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.

A good use case for API Routes is handling form input. For example, you can create a form on your page and have it send a `POST` request to your API Route. You can then write code to directly save it to your database. The API Route code will not be part of your client bundle, so you can safely write server-side code.

### Deploy to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** platform developed by the creators of Next.js.
