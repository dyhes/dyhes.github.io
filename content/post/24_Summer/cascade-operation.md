## Types
* ALL: Applies all cascade types
* PERSIST: Cascades the persist (**create**) operation
* MERGE: Cascades the merge (**update**) operation
* REMOVE: Cascades the remove (**delete**) operation
* REFRESH: Cascades the refresh operation
* DETACH: Cascades the detach operation
## Common use cases
* CascadeType.PERSIST: When you **save** a parent entity, all its child entities are also saved.
* CascadeType.REMOVE: When you **delete** a parent entity, all its child entities are also deleted.
* CascadeType.ALL: Applies all cascade types, useful when you want full propagation of operations.
## Benefits
* Simplifies entity management by automating related entity operations
* Helps maintain data integrity and consistency
* **Reduces boilerplate code** for handling related entities
## Best practices
**Avoid using CascadeType.ALL by default**
* Don't automatically apply CascadeType.ALL to every @OneToMany relationship
* Can lead to unexpected behavior and potential issues
**Use specific cascade types**
* Choose cascade types that match your specific needs:
  * CascadeType.PERSIST: For saving related entities
  * CascadeType.REMOVE: For deleting related entities
  * CascadeType.MERGE: For updating related entities
**Be cautious with CascadeType.REMOVE**
* Can lead to unintended deletions
* Consider **using orphanRemoval=true instead** for more controlled deletions
**Avoid cascades for shared references**
* Don't use cascades when child entities can **exist independently or be shared**
* Example: User (parent) and Address (child) where addresses might be shared
**Consider performance implications**
* Cascading operations can impact performance, especially with large datasets
* Use judiciously and test thoroughly
## Conversation with Claude 3.5
Can i understand cascade operations like this: it is only necessary when i need to update entity from the non-owning part (namely the collection field holder, the one part in a @OneToMany relationship)?
> Your understanding is on the right track, but it's not entirely accurate.
> 
> Cascade operations are not only necessary when updating an entity from the non-owning side (the collection field holder in a @OneToMany relationship). They are useful in various scenarios, regardless of which side of the relationship you're operating on.
> 
> **Cascade from parent to children:** In a @OneToMany relationship, you might want to cascade operations from the parent (the "one" side) to the children (the "many" side). This is **common** when the child entities' lifecycle is dependent on the parent.
> 
> **Cascade from child to parent:** In some cases, you might want to cascade operations from the child to the parent. This is less common but can be useful in certain scenarios.
> 
> **Bidirectional relationships:** In bidirectional relationships, you can define cascades on both sides, although this requires **careful consideration** to avoid unintended consequences.
