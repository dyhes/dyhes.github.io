>  In IntelliJ IDEA, ensure that the project is set to build automatically. Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Compiler`, and check the option **Build project automatically**. This setting allows the IDE to compile changes without needing to manually trigger a build each time
